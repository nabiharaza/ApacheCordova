The file is zipped. Please feel free to download it and fiddle with the code

Cordova Plugins Used:
  1. Camera.
  2. Accerloremter
  3. Device Motion Sensor
  4. Email Client
  5. Battery
  
  
  
The app takes a picture on shake and opens the email client for it to be sent. It also changes the colour of the background of the web/mobile app. Battery Plugin is also integrated. 
  
The app is made in Webstorm but if you are using Visual Studio you might need to change a slight code here and there. You can google that easily. Not major difference just slight.
  
  Ill also post the same code that should run is Visual Studio too.
  
  Till then Happy Apache Cordova-ing!
